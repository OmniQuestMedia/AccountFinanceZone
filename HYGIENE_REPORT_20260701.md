## 2. Findings table

| # | Dimension | Verdict | Evidence (path:line) | Disposition |
|---|-----------|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| 4A#1 | Clean-state gate (lint/tsc/test/build/ship-gate) | **CONFIRMED green** | see §5 verification | Verified locally after install workaround |
| 4A#1 | Coverage vs TECH_DEBT report | **NEW (drift, benign)** | `TECH_DEBT_AND_COVERAGE_REPORT.md:44-51` | Report snapshot 163 tests/18 suites @84.29% stmts; **actual now 184 tests/23 suites @85.3% stmts / 87.37% lines**. Suite grew since report; coverage in same band. No regression. Dated snapshot — not edited. |
| 4A#2 | Prisma 5 vs program-standard 6 | **CONFIRMED** | `package.json:24,38` both `^5.22.0` | Cross-repo major divergence. **SURFACED (§5.3)** — gated major, not a safe-fix. |
| 4A#2 | eslint `^10.4.0` resolves? | **REFUTED (no issue)** | `package-lock.json` → `eslint@10.4.0` (real published) | Resolves to a real version. No correction needed. |
| 4A#2 | Other pins (ts 5.7, @types/node 22, NestJS 11) | **CONFIRMED sane** | `package.json:21-41` | No action. |
| 4A#3 | `engines` field absent | **CONFIRMED** | `package.json` (was absent) | **FIXED (§4B)** — added `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`. |
| 4A#4 | Lockfile present/current | **CONFIRMED** | `package-lock.json` (481 resolved entries); CI uses `npm ci` | Committed & current. Not regenerated. **NEW:** a stale `yarn.lock` also exists (dual lockfile) — see §5.9. |
| 4A#5 | Prisma posture (env-only, migrations) | **CONFIRMED** | `prisma/schema.prisma:5-8` `url = env("DATABASE_URL")` | No inline secret. **No `prisma/migrations/` dir** and no `migration_lock.toml` (schema-push posture). Append-only models `LedgerEntry`, `AuditTrail` present. No schema/migration change made. |
| 4A#6 | Phantom-import sweep | **REFUTED** | `src/**`, `services/**` | No `*orchestrator*`, `../core-api/*`, `../accounts/*`, `../redroomrewards/*`, or other non-resolving imports. All imports resolve to internal modules or real deps. |
| 4A#7 | Stale-branch inventory | **REFUTED** | `git branch -r` | Remote holds only `origin/main` + this working branch. All named stale branches (adoring-fermat, affectionate-darwin, gracious-hypatia, jolly-turing, magical-cori, copilot/run-hygiene-audit) are **already deleted**. Nothing to prune. Docs still referencing them are stale snapshots (§5.8). |
| 4A#8 | Dependabot / advisories | **CONFIRMED (5 advisories)** | `npm audit` | 2 non-breaking dev-transitive (@babel/core, js-yaml); 3 high on `multer` whose only offered fix is a **breaking NestJS downgrade**. **SURFACED (§5.10)** — none auto-applied (all touch the gated lockfile). |
| 4A#9 | CI + financial-invariants intact | **CONFIRMED intact** | `.github/workflows/financial-invariants-check.yml` | Encodes ledger-mutation guard, hardcoded-live-key scan, cash-refund scan, three-bucket check. **Not modified** (governance → §5). |
| 4A#10 | No identity graph / firewall | **CONFIRMED intact** | `src/**` | No name→account resolver, no token→name capability. Finance keys anonymously by `accountId`/`creator_id`/`guest_id` (opaque IDs/UUIDs). Event egress carries no PII (`src/events/ecomms-zone.client.ts`). |
| 4A#10 | Payout-destination PII / PCI scope | **CONFIRMED (known signal)** | `prisma/schema.prisma:147-161` | `CreatorPayoutPreference` holds `etransfer_email` (152), `mailing_address` (153), `crypto_wallet_address` (154). **SURFACED (§5.1)** — top priority. Schema untouched. |
| 4A#10 | PII encryption asymmetry | **NEW** | `src/payouts/creator-payout-preference.service.ts:58,60,72,74` | JSON fields (`direct_deposit_details`, `wire_details`, `mailing_address`) are AES-256-GCM encrypted before store; **`etransfer_email` and `crypto_wallet_address` are stored PLAINTEXT**. Feeds §5.1 decision. Not altered. |
| 4A#10 | Sole ledger writer / append-only | **CONFIRMED** | `src/ledger/ledger.service.ts:44-66` (hash-chained `appendEntry`, no update/delete) | Ledger-mutation grep on `prisma/`+`src/` returned empty (invariant holds). |
| 4A#10 | token-not-PAN | **CONFIRMED** | `prisma/schema.prisma:31-42`; `PCI_SCOPE_MINIMIZATION.md:139-155` | `PaymentMethodToken` stores `providerToken`/`tokenFingerprint`, never raw PAN. |
| 4A#10 | Zero consumer/identity surface | **CONFIRMED** | `README.md:1-6` | Finance-only bounded context; no accounts UI. |
| — | `services/stripe/StripeService.ts` orphan | **CONFIRMED dead-but-doc-referenced** | `services/stripe/StripeService.ts`; `README.md:31`; `docs/standards/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` | Out of build/lint/test perimeter, but two migration docs still point at it as an audit item. Removal is **gated** (would need doc edits presupposing a decision) → §5.11. Not removed. |

## 3. Applied safe-fixes (§4B)

| Fix | File | Commit |
|-----|------|--------|
| Added `engines.node` = `">=20"` | `package.json` (+3 lines) | `385d9ad` |

- **Only** change in the pushed diff. No source, schema, workflow, or lockfile touched.
- An unintended transitive `qs` bump that appeared in `yarn.lock` during dependency install was **reverted** before commit — it was not part of the confirmed subset and the lockfile is gated.

Nothing else on the §4B allowlist was actionable: eslint pin is valid (no correction), no confirmed-dead phantom imports exist, no stale branches remain to prune, and the advisory fixes all rewrite the gated lockfile (surfaced instead).

## 4. Surfaced decisions (§5) — Kevin's calls, not applied

1. **[TOP PRIORITY] Payout-destination PII / PCI scope.** `CreatorPayoutPreference` (`prisma/schema.prisma:147-161`) stores re-identifying payout destinations: `etransfer_email`, `crypto_wallet_address`, `mailing_address`, plus `direct_deposit_details`/`wire_details`. Decision needed against `PCI_SCOPE_MINIMIZATION.md`: **in-scope for Finance** (needed to disburse) **vs. tokenize/reference from AccountsZone** (keep the firewall's anonymous end truly anonymous). Note the PCI doc's encrypted-fields list (`PCI_SCOPE_MINIMIZATION.md:215-217`) covers only `PaymentMethodToken` — it is **silent on these payout fields**, so scope doctrine has a gap here.
   - **Sub-finding (new):** `etransfer_email` and `crypto_wallet_address` are stored **in plaintext**, while the JSON payout blobs are encrypted (`creator-payout-preference.service.ts:58,60,72,74`). If these fields stay in-scope, the asymmetry is worth closing; either way it's a schema/doctrine change for you, not a hygiene fix.
2. **Identity-resolution / firewall weakening.** None found — reported as clean. No action requested; flagged so the negative result is on record.
3. **Prisma 5 → 6 alignment.** Repo on `^5.22.0` (internally aligned); program standard is 6 (AccountsZone on 6.7). Gated, ledger-sensitive major — timing is an architect/program call.
4. **eslint `^10` correction target.** Not needed — `10.4.0` resolves to a real published version.
5. **`engines` value.** Applied `>=20` (program D7; lowest Node in CI). Alternative `>=22` to match AccountsZone — say the word and I'll switch it.
6. **Ledger schema / migration need.** None applied; there is no `prisma/migrations/` dir (schema-push posture). Any migration is money-sensitive + doctrine-gated.
7. **Workflow / invariants governance.** `financial-invariants-check.yml` intact and load-bearing — not modified.
8. **Stale merged-branch prune list.** Empty — the remote already holds only `main` + this branch. Docs that still list stale branches (`README.md:30`, `docs/standards/BRANCH_HYGIENE.md`) are dated snapshots; refreshing them is optional doc-hygiene (left untouched to avoid rewriting historical audit records).
9. **Dual lockfile.** Both `package-lock.json` (used by CI `npm ci`) and `yarn.lock` are committed. The `yarn.lock` appears vestigial. Removing it is reversible but touches lockfile territory (gated) — recommend a decision rather than an autonomous delete.
10. **Advisories (`npm audit`).** 5 total: `@babel/core` (moderate, dev-transitive), `js-yaml` (moderate, dev-transitive) — both fixable non-breaking; `multer` ×2 (high, transitive via `@nestjs/platform-express`) whose only offered fix **downgrades `@nestjs/core` to 7.5.5 (breaking major)** — do not `audit fix --force`. Even the two non-breaking fixes rewrite the gated `package-lock.json`. Approve and I'll apply the babel/js-yaml patch bumps in an isolated commit; the multer high is really an upstream NestJS bump to track.
11. **`services/stripe/` orphan.** Dead from a tooling view but still referenced as an audit item in `README.md:31` and `docs/standards/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`. Decide: (a) wire a real Stripe integration under lint/test, or (b) delete the dir and strike both doc references in one change.
12. **Optional validation PR.** A `claude/*` push triggers no CI here and there's no auto-merge workflow, so a validation-only PR would run CI (ci, super-linter, ship-gate, financial-invariants) safely at CodeQL cost. Default stays push-only; open one on request if you want CI-green confirmation.

## 5. Verification (local — no branch CI)

Dependencies were installed offline (`npm ci --offline --ignore-scripts`, all 481 lockfile entries served from a primed cache) after transient registry/CDN `ECONNRESET`s; the Prisma schema-engine binary was fetched with a resumable `curl -C -` and Prisma Client generated locally. The `engines` change is metadata-only and cannot affect the gate, so before == after.

| Gate | Command | Before | After (with fix) |
|------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Lint | `eslint {src,test}/**/*.ts` | ✅ exit 0 | ✅ exit 0 |
| Type-check | `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ exit 0 | ✅ exit 0 |
| Tests | `jest` | ✅ 184 passed / 23 suites | ✅ 184 passed / 23 suites |
| Build | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` | ✅ `dist/main.js` | ✅ `dist/main.js` |
| Ship-gate | `ts-node PROGRAM_CONTROL/ship-gate-verifier.ts` | ✅ passed (exit 0) | ✅ passed (exit 0) |

Ship-gate reports "human review required: yes" only because, with no base SHA locally, it scans all tracked files (which include `src/ledger/**` and `prisma/**`). The **actual pushed diff touches neither** — it is `package.json` only.

No secret, `.env`, financial PII, card data, or build artifact was staged. Diff = the confirmed §4B subset only.
